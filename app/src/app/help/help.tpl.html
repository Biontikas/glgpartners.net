        <h2>Q: WHAT ARE GLG’S TRADE IDEAS OBJECTIVES?</h2>

        <p>
            A: Trade ideas objectives include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>FUNDAMENTALLY DRIVEN MEDIUM TERM IDEAS</em> (long/short) with 60-90 days average duration.</li>
            <li><em>MAXIMISE EXCESS RETURNS</em> (long/short) vs. the SXXP - DOW JONES STOXX 600 PRICE INDEX EUR
                [Bloomberg: SXXP Index].
            </li>
            <li><em>CONSECUTIVE BEST IDEAS</em> in each industry – NOT a portfolio of ideas.</li>
            <li><em>NO SHORT TERM, LIQUIDITY DRIVEN IDEAS</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Q: HOW DO YOU MEASURE AND RANK PERFORMANCE IN TRADE IDEAS?</h2>

        <p>
            A: We use the following approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>WE USE MARKET NEUTRAL RETURNS</em> − market neutral returns drive our rankings and any net industry
                exposure will be implicitly hedged against the SXXP Index.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>WE CALCULATE CAPITAL USED FROM THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CAPITAL COMMITTED TO AN IDEA SINCE INCEPTION</em>
                – the calculation is intended to encourage simple ideas (i.e. put on / take off) rather than actively
                traded ideas
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>% VALUE CONTRIBUTION</em> − this drives commission allocation. We calculate value contribution using
                the market neutral return of all your ideas within each industry, as before.
                <ul>
                    <li>Top quintile = 4 points</li>
                    <li>Second quintile = 2 points</li>
                    <li>Third quintile = 1 point</li>
                    <li>Fourth quintile = 0 points</li>
                    <li>Fifth quintile = -1 points</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>NEGATIVE MARKET NEUTRAL RETURNS</em> - We deduct a penalty of 1 point from your score in each
                industry that you have produced negative market neutral returns on a 12 month basis. This allows us to
                give a higher reward to brokers who consistently outperform the market versus those who do not. For
                example, if you are ranked in the 5th quintile, for any industry, you would normally receive -1 points.
                But if your market neutral return in that industry is negative, then you will be penalised 1 extra point
                making your score for that industry -2. Similarly, in the event that you would rank in the top quintile
                and have negative returns you will receive 3 points instead of the usual 4. This applies to all
                quintiles, all industries and all brokers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>VALUE CONTRIBUTION</em> - % value contribution = Sum of your industry points/Total points awarded.
                Points are allocated only once per industry, not on individual ideas. More ideas do not necessarily mean
                more points.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>SIZE WEIGHTED RETURNS</em> − We use equal weighted returns.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>CUMULATIVE RETURN</em> − concurrent ideas within the same industry average their returns,
                consecutive ideas compound them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>INDUSTRY VS MARKET</em> − since net industry exposure means an implicit over/under weight versus
                SXXP Index, you can use stocks or industry index positions to manage this exposure.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>NOTES ON CALCULATIONS</em> - Percentage returns are calculated using a cost-based methodology. The
                return on your idea is the sum of the daily percentage returns calculated as the market neutral P&amp;L
                divided by the cost of the idea on each day. As you are judged on percentage returns and not P&amp;L,
                the cost on which your returns are calculated will never reduce. This is because if you reduce your
                position, the cost must remain the same in order for the percentage returns to be scaled down. If the
                cost were reduced with your position then the percentage return would be the same regardless of any
                scaling of your idea. However, when increasing the size of an idea beyond its original size, the cost
                will increase so that your returns will not scale up with your position. This has an important impact on
                the way in which positions should be managed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Q: HOW DOES YOUR POSITION SIZING WORK, AND WHEN DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR CONTRIBUTORS TO SCALE UP
            POSITIONS?</h2>

        <p>
            A: There are a number of important points to highlight:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>MAXIMUM POSITION</em> - We allow a maximum position of EUR10 million per idea.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>WHEN SCALING UP POSITIONS MAKES SENSE</em> - The only circumstances under which a scaling up above
                the initial idea size would be of benefit are:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If the stock price is currently less favourable than the initial starting price but you think it
                        will now rally in your favour (then scaling up will reduce your weighted average cost price,
                        increasing your returns going forward)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you would like to give a higher weighting to an idea that is performing well in its sector
                        and are prepared to have reduced returns going forward in order to do that.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>COMMON MISTAKES</em> - A common misinterpretation is, if your idea is doing well, increasing your
                position will give you higher returns. It will in fact dilute your returns as the price at which your
                extra units are bought (assuming you are long) will be higher than the starting price of the idea,
                increasing your average cost price (and vice versa for shorts).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Q: HOW DO YOU CALCULATE FILL PRICES AND WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF TRADING?</h2>

        <p>
            A: Once an order is input into Trade Ideas, we use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>“1/5 OF VOLUME” VWAP</em> to fill your order (i.e. 5 times your order quantity must trade before
                your order is filled). On top of this fill price there are 20bps of fees added to simulate transaction
                costs. These 20bps will be applied to all fills including scaling and closing trades.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>ILLIQUID STOCKS SUFFER</em> - very illiquid stocks will suffer from having to wait for three times
                the volume to trade. When entering ideas on illiquid stocks, be sure that the size you choose is
                realistic. Being able to trade only small quantities also means the weighting of your idea will be
                reduced, so ideas on illiquid stocks must have an extremely high conviction for them to be worthwhile.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Q: WHAT COMMON FACTORS HAVE YOU OBSERVED IN TOP TRADE IDEAS CONTRIBUTORS?</h2>

        <p>
            A: Top contributors share the following attributes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>UNDERSTAND GLG’S OBJECTIVES</em> – in terms of trade duration and excess returns.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>MONETIZE THEIR EDGE</em> - by working closely with their team of analysts to identify best ideas and
                use considerable judgment and experience to screen these before entering these into the GLG trade ideas
                system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>CONTROL RISK</em> – by monitoring their positions daily and reviewing these with analysts,
                particularly when down more than 20% on a market neutral basis.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>MAINTAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS</em> – top contributors have a high level of awareness of the current
                factors affecting their portfolio from both a top down and bottom up perspective. This manifests itself
                as regular idea updates, changes and alignment of views.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>SYSTEMATIC APPROACH</em> – a disciplined approach to reviewing loss making positions and working
                with analysts is a good foundation for success.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Q: HOW DO I CHECK THE PERFORMANCE OF A SPECIFIC IDEA?</h2>

        <p>
            A: Open the Daily Historical Returns Calculation by clicking the idea number in your portfolio view.

        </p>


        <h2>Q: WHAT ARE THE INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATIONS?</h2>

        <p>
            A: We use our own internal industry classification scheme. Once you have entered a new idea, the industry
            classification field will be automatically filled.
        </p>

        <p>
            The list of industries in our internal classification is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automobiles &amp; Components</li>
            <li>Banks</li>
            <li>Capital Goods</li>
            <li>Chemicals</li>
            <li>Commercial Services &amp; Supplies</li>
            <li>Construction Materials, Containers &amp; Packaging, Paper &amp; Forestry</li>
